# SemesterProject_1
First semester project Software Engineering, Single User system

The project works to provide a work-planning tool for the Chemistry Department ofEurofins Steins Laboratory A/S. 
The aim is to provide a software system that will ease and
automatize the managerial work subsequently freeing up time and effort for the department.
In order to achieve that, the project must be able to provide capabilities to view multiple
sheets at a time: modify, store and update dat.It will also offer a graphical user interface and basic level of security.
In the development process, different analytical and designing tools were used,
everything being done in a Waterfall model and the implementation of the system was
done using JAVA programming language.
In the end, the result of this project was summarized in form of a software system, that
does provide the basic needs for such a work-planning tool, but not sufficient to make it
valuable enough in the current state. The needed improvements for the software to become what
it was intended to are suggested as well as discussions for the current shortcomings.

The project was made during the first semester at the VIA university college during an Software engineering Bachelor.
It was made by a group with 4 members.
